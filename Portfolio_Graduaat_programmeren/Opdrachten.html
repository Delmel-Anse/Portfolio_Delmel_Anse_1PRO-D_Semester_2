            <h3>POP – reflection exercise</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise we needed to reflect on a 2 situations in 2 different ways: STARR-method and Kolb. <br>
                The goal was to learn how to reflect on a situation, so you learn things out of them. My <br>
                experience in this exercise was that it was quite easy because I had to reflect on many situations in <br>
                my previous study. I just dusted off my reflection skills and looked at how the 2 methods on how <br>
                to use them properly.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>POP – planning exercise</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise we needed to make a planning of the next 2 weeks at that time. I learned about how <br>
                handy planning can be and how important it is to plan your day, so you have time too yourself <br>
                and not get consumed by school or work. The difficulties I had was finding stuff to add because I <br>
                am a person that does things on the fly instead of planning it.
            </p>

            <h3>POP – Exercise guest speaker</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise we needed to talk about what we thought about the guest speaker. We had to answer <br>
                a few questions about what the guest speaker talked about and I learned about 1 of the massive <br>
                choice in the field of being a programmer. It’s quite interesting that there are workplaces that <br>
                are for testing programs and projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Project web and C#</h3>
            <p>
                This was the last thing we had to do for Werkplekleren 1. Web project entails me making a CV in a <br>
                website and complying with all the things that the project asks for. The C# project entails making <br>
                a fully fledged cookie clicker application with working cookie to click and everything else needed <br>
                according to the project details. I learned a lot about C# and refreshed my knowledge of css and <br>
                html also learning a few more things which will be useful.
            </p>

            <h3>Groepsproject</h3>
            <p>
                We had to do a group project that lasted from 15th of February until the 30th of May. We had too <br>
                develop a front-end that is connected too a back-end coded with C# that had controllers that <br>
                would connect too your local database for several things like logging in, registering, making <br>
                orders, filling certain pages with all the products by getting all the data from the database. In our <br>
                case we made a renting service for retro consoles that had taken inspiration from retro arcade <br>
                with neon colours and a font that resembles text from and arcade machine.
