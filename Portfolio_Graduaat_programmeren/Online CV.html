        <h1>~ About Me ~</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Anse Delmel. I am 21 years old and am a student at the school PXL Hasselt<br/>
        I am studying for my graduate degree in programming and am currently in my first semester of my first year. <br/>
        My hobbies are swimming, cooking and school ofcourse. <br/>
        I have a basic understanding on C#, HTML, CSS and I can navigate my way through a database by using SQL. <br/>
        </p>

        <h1>~ Education ~</h1>
        <h4>//secondary school//</h4>
        <h6>//social technical science//</h6>
        <p>I finished my studies on 30/06/2020 with passable grades. The study was mainly about social science and science <br/>
        and not really computer oriëntated. </p>

        <h4>//College UCLL//</h4>
        <h6>//Graduate in orthopedagogy//</h6>
        <p>I began in September 2020 and ended it in Januari of 2021. I didn't get passing grades besides on my practical part.</p>


        <h4>//Community college//</h4>
        <h6>//Youth and disabled care//</h6>
        <p>I began in Februari 2021 and ended it at June 2023. It was a hard decision to stop something you worked so hard
            <br> towards but my mental health was declining and through reflecting and help from outside sources. I chose another study that
            <br>made me happy but learned some valuable skills from my time here.</p>


        <h4>//College PXL//</h4>
        <h6>//Graduate in programming//</h6>
        <p>I began in September 2023 and am still going strong. The end is in June 2025</p>

        <p>My technical skills are still a work in progress since i am only still a noobie (rookie) that means there is still room for improvements. <br>
            In my opinion HTML and CSS is wear I made the most progress in a short time in. C# and sql needs a bit more
            <br> practice memorising what certain commands do and what they can be used for. You know what they say
            <br>practice makes perfect and i am never done practicing and learning. </p>

        <p>My social skills are as you can see more developed cause of my previous education in the care system.<br>
            I know how to listen too people and sum up everything they say to make sure I got everything out of the <br>
            conversation I need. Very handy for if you need to make a project according to a clients specifications.
            <br>Being helpful is good thing to have in the workplace so everything keeps running smoothly especially if
            <br>someone is stuck on something important that puts the project on hold.
            <br>Being open on the other hand can be a good and bad thing you need to find balance. Its important
            <br>to share your feelings if something isn't go right like when your stuck on a piece of code that doesn't
            <br>that doesn't work for some reason, but don't over share cause when you share personal things from your
            <br>private life where no people have business with you shouldn't share that with the team.
            <br>last but not least following instructions. Its goes in hand with active listening. If you didn't listen
            <br>too what you have to do how can you do your instructions. It's also a good skill to have cause if
            <br>you don't follow instructions and do your own thing cause it can mess up a project.</p>
