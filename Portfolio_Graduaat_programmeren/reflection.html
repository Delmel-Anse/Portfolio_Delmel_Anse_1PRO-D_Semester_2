            <br>
            <h3>My Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                My personal strengths are that I am friendly, kind and call and some of my weaknesses is asocial, <br>
                chaotic and impatient. <br>
                <br>
                Your friendly and kind nature in personal life cultivates positive relationships, fostering a supportive <br>
                and harmonious environment. Being approachable, you create lasting connections and <br>
                contribute to a fulfilling social life. <br>
                <br>
                asocial tendencies may limit your opportunities for meaningful social connections and networking, <br>
                potentially hindering personal and professional growth. Chaotic behaviour can lead to <br>
                disorganization and inefficiency, impacting your ability to meet deadlines or maintain a <br>
                structured lifestyle. Impatience may result in overlooking important details or rushing through <br>
                tasks, potentially compromising the quality of your work and relationships. Recognizing and <br>
                addressing these weaknesses can help you mitigate their negative effects and foster a more <br>
                balanced and successful life. <br>
                <br>
                My professional strengths are loyal, alert and enthusiastic but my professional weaknesses are being <br>
                a perfectionist, shy, closed. <br>
                <br>

                Your loyalty in a professional setting establishes trust and reliability, enhancing teamwork and <br>
                fostering a positive work environment. Your alertness ensures you stay attentive to details, <br>
                aiding in problem-solving and contributing to effective decision-making. Enthusiasm can inspire <br>
                colleagues, boosting morale and creating a proactive atmosphere for achieving shared goals. <br>
                <br>
                However, perfectionism may lead to prolonged work processes, hindering efficiency and potentially <br>
                causing unnecessary stress. Shyness may limit your ability to communicate effectively, <br>
                impacting networking and collaborative efforts. Being closed may hinder the exchange of ideas, <br>
                hindering innovation and growth. Balancing these traits is essential for a well-rounded <br>
                professional approach, allowing you to leverage your strengths while mitigating the potential <br>
                negative impact of your weaknesses.

            <h3>POP-reflection</h3>
            <p>
                <span>What have I learned from the POP-session?</span> <br>
                I learned from that POP-session that planning is quite important in your life, so you get a balance <br>
                between work and free time. Its needed cause a human brain can only remember so much and <br>
                if youâ€™re a forgetful person a planning can be a lifesaver for your personal and professional life. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span>How can this session be implemented in you daily life as a programmer?</span> <br>
                Making a planning is very important in my life, so I know what the next day brings. It's needed to <br>
                remember important deadlines and project parts you took on yourself. But also for example <br>
                important appointments for a psychologist or an important visit too family. At least that is one of <br>
                the many applications of a planning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>X-factor reflection</h3>
            <p>what I learned from the X-factor is that I have certain qualities of the x-factor in me but some I <br>
            still need to work on others. For example (em)passie is something I am good at I have a passion for my <br>
            study and my empathie helps with helping my fellow students with school and if they don't see a mistake they<br>
            made in there code. (international) teamwork and networking is something I still need to work on because i
                <br>
            am still very asocial and need to be open for more contact with people. so what I learned is <br>
            I still have a long way before I have the X factor, but I know it's in all of us</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Personal reflection group project WPL2</h3>
            <p>
                The project was very educational but challenging because we had to learn many new things first. <br>
                The tasks were clearly formulated, and we knew what we needed to achieve. I had a reasonable amount of<br>
                support from my team members and lecturers. My team members picked up on things when I had no idea or<br>
                when things became too overwhelming to think clearly. The lecturers were also a very good source of <br>
                knowledge because they helped us write proper controllers with safe queries. They also gave good tips<br>
                that helped us understand how to approach things in terms of code or even find mistakes that we didn't see.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my opinion, the most important thing I learned in this project is how to make a connection between<br>
                a front-end and a back-end. Additionally, understanding how controllers and classes work together was<br>
                extremely educational and will be beneficial for future projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking improved through this project because I became better at asking questions and using<br>
                the right resources like ChatGPT. As I mentioned earlier, the lecturers were also a good source of <br>
                information. Creativity, in my personal opinion, has remained the same. The only area where I became<br>
                a bit more creative was in adapting code to work for other, similar purposes. Independence <br>
                consistently increased during the project because, since sprint 3, we asked fewer questions and found<br>
                our own solutions to problems. This ultimately led us to complete the project, although it still had<br>
                its bugs and features that needed addressing.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I would change about our collaboration is that we should have done more after class to get more<br>
                done and, by extension, deliver better quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would add and improve certain features to our controllers, such as an additional feature that <br>
                changes values from ordered to canceled. With the knowledge I have now, I could also complete <br>
                everything faster, allowing more time for extra features.
                <br>
                <br>
                Regarding the factors of the X-factor, I possess aspects of several such as collaboration, empathy, <br>
                and being (multi)disciplinary, but entrepreneurial & innovative still needs a lot of work. <br>
                Collaboration took the forefront because we had to create a group project over several months. <br>
                This allowed me to dust off skills like communication and mediation, but also to pay attention to <br>
                my tendency to be condescending. I also focused on not always saying yes to everything, so I could <br>
                occasionally take care of myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                Empathy is one of the two parts I definitely possess. I can put myself in someone else's shoes <br>
                without it negatively affecting me. This allows me to immerse myself in someone's story and <br>
                transform it into an idea, for example, a website layout that aligns with the client's vision. <br>
                Passion is also present, but to a lesser extent. I was passionate about the group project and coding,<br>
                but this waned a bit over the course of the project.
                <br>
                <br>
                (Multi)disciplinary: I have certain skills that I can use in different situations, such as <br>
                listening to what people want, being flexible, and self-discipline. Listening to the client <br>
                (lecturers in this case) but also listening to your team, being flexible to do more than one thing <br>
                and thus being useful in multiple languages, and self-discipline to finish what I start but also <br>
                knowing when I can't continue because I've reached my limit.
                <br>
                <br>
                ondernemen and innovatief: I also improved in taking initiative/entrepreneurship because I <br>
                took on the role of scrummaster. Additionally, if no one took on a difficult task, I took the leap <br>
                of faith and took on these tasks to learn and see how I could do things like creating controllers.
