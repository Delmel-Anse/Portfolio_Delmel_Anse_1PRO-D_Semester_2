        <h1>Why did I choose for Graduate in programming</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I was following another study called youth and disabled care. It was a study that entailed being <br>
            social, assertive, strong on your feet and a good with people. I after a few years realized it wasn’t for <br>
            me and during that time I was still forced to do school stuff. I looked into what I could do and I <br>
            gotten interested in coding. I started looking into schools that offered coding studies and came <br>
            across Graduate in programming given by PXL. I had to convince my parents that this would be a <br>
            good thing for me mentally and academically. I told them I would love the study and I was right. <br>
            I am very interested in the coding lessons I got and learned a lot about html, css, C# and sql.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>why do I think that the job of a programmer fits me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I think the job of a programmer would fit be for a few reasons. The first reason is that I am good at <br>
            following orders too the letter. It’s something that I do so when something went wrong I can give <br>
            the explanation I was following what people said. Second is that I am someone who can <br>
            hyper-focus on things so if I am given a task my undivided attention and make it like the client <br>
            want it too. Last I am a team player and will help others with problems. I want to help people <br>
            where I can and keep the flow going.

        <h3>Designer:</h3>
        <p>
            I can estimate if I have enough in my project to be in line with the communicated specifications of <br>
            the project, but what I have difficulties with is making a proposal for the standard on the design, <br>
            the best programming language and the methods that are going to be used for the project cause <br>
            for 1 I don’t have knowledge about languages outside C#, html, css and sql. Because I never had <br>
            to do anything with it yet. This will change in the future but in the grand scheme of things I am <br>
            just starting out on my journey as programmer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title__example">Examples:</h3>
        <p>
            1. I had to make a window for my cookie clicker project is one because you had to make it look <br>
            decent and had to decide what code to use in the main window. <br>
            2. Learning the drag and drop system in visual studio and evolving that knowledge by learning <br>
            grid code so you can add elements yourself instead of dragging them on the window. It’s <br>
            a good example of being a designer cause of again working in a main window layout<br>
            3.  I was talking to a friend about how we should split our windows and I proposed using <br>
            Grind.Column.Definitions to split them in 3 part. This is an example of proposing something in the design of a window.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 >Programmer:</h3>
        <p>
            I can properly declare names in the proper way like Camel and Pascal case. I can also estimate <br>
            roughly what code I need to write to get something to happen that I need to happen but I have <br>
            noticed I don’t do very well further than estimating what I need. Setting the logic into C# <br>
            occasionally fails me cause C# doesn’t think like me and doesn’t make links my does. Though on <br>
            the other hand changing and keeping the code up to date is more my strong suit cause when I <br>
            write code I make mental notes of what certain part do and cause in my application.
            <br>
        </p>


        <h3 class="title__example">Examples:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Learning where to use pascal and camel casings to properly program certain things. <br>
            2. Using breakpoints to look at mistakes I may or may not have made. Using that is good for <br>
            changing code and you get an error <br>
            3. Changing code or adding to it and modifying the code, so I can use the added code for <br>
            buttons for example. Its an example of changing code that needs it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Tester:</h3>
        <p>
            I know how to test certain parts of my application like when you have textboxes that only need <br>
            numbers, I know how to test if I have added a certain functionality and check in the textboxes so <br>
            I can either have a textbox pop up or even prohibit the use of keys besides the numbers. But <br>
            then again if I make a mistake that I can’t find immediately I cannot find it properly with break <br>
            points but I will eventually find it just takes time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title__example">Examples:</h3>
        <p>
            1. I use tests learned from our teacher for example typing letters in textboxes that only need <br>
            numbers in them and if that gives an error I obviously add too the code  so the same <br>
            error won’t occur again. That is how you test an application like a calculator. <br>
            2. Using breakpoint to see where an error occurs or where something doesn’t happen where <br>
            there should be happening something<br>
            3. I can work with feedback someone gives me and make the necessary changes for that <br>
            feedback to work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Communicator/ Teamplayer: </h3>
        <p>
            I can easily work together and help people I usual help friends with searching for mistakes in there <br>
            code or help them find the right code to use in a method but documenting is less of my strong <br>
            suit I keep coding and don’t really put documentation down when I write code but I do put it <br>
            after everything is done but in a team setting is that not a good thing to do. My commits on the <br>
            other hand do have the info needed on what I did in that commit. <br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="title__example">Example:</h3>
        <p>
            1. I helped a friend find an error in his code so his application works. Example teamplayer cause <br>
            you helped someone with there code. <br>
            2. I added documentation in my cookie clicker so my teachers know what my code does and <br>
            what does what. Example of making it easier for your colleagues to know what your <br>
            code does. <br>
            3. My commits always have descriptions that say what I worked on which gives info to my <br>
            colleagues on what I have done in that coding project.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Lifelong learning IT-professional: </h3>
        <p>
            Since I am still in school learning about code almost every day I am always learning new things and at <br>
            home I learn new ways to link methods too buttons and so on. But this only happens in my <br>
            projects I need to do for school so outside of school I am not learning new things out of my own <br>
            free will but because I need to for school.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="title__example">Example:</h3>
        <p>
            1. I practice on a regular basis to keep my coding knowledge fresh in my brain so I don’t forget <br>
            certain thing that can help with for example exams. This is an example of knowledge up <br>
            to date. <br>
            2. I have noticed since I finished the cookie clicker application I noticed I am getting better in <br>
            coding. I noticed when I look back at the first few things we learned from C# essentials it <br>
            felt basic and something we know with our eyes closed. It’s an example of self-<br>
            knowledge and knowing what I can do and not. <br>
            3. I look up things I don’t know and read up on how these things work and then try to use them <br>
            in a project. This is another example of keeping your knowledge up to date. <br>
