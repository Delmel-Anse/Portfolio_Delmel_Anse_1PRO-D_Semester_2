            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome too my portfolio. The contents of this portfolio has my CV, reflections, my school exercises <br>
            , my logbook with all the things I did in Werkplekleren 1 and de reason why I chose to follow programming.<br>
            I wish you (whoever you are) happy reading and have a wonderful day. <br>
            My CV contains my personal info, what I can do, my skills, a lil intro and about me. It's a separate page<br>
            showing how far I am at with my html and css skills. <br>
            In my reflection page you will see how I view my skills, progress, what I have learned, how I think <br>
            I can better my skills, what I have learned out of things school told me to do, etc. <br>
            My school exercises page is obviously somewhere where I will talk about all <br>
            my exercises I made when school asked me to aka the POP-Exercises. I am going to talk about what I learned <br>
            and what I had difficulties with. <br>
            My logbook is basically just the whole agenda of what we did in Werkplekleren 1. <br>
            The last page will be my explanation of why I chose to start this study, what interested me, what skills<br>
            I possess that align with the skills of a programmer, where I am at with those skills and <br>
            what I still need to work on within those skills.</p>
